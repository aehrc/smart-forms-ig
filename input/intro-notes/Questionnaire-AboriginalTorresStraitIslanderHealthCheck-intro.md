### Background

The long-term vision for effective Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks is of a standards-based health check template that is consistent and interoperable across different systems and applications whilst allowing for local adaptation.

The NACCHO and RACGP established a working group to review the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander annual health check templates and have produced five new templates that span the life course:

1. Infants and preschool (birth-5 years)
2. Primary school age (5-12 years)
3. Adolescents and young people (12-24 years)
4. Adults (25-49 years) 
5. Older people (50+ years)

These example templates can be downloaded from the [RACGP](https://www.racgp.org.au/the-racgp/faculties/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-health/guides/resources/2019-mbs-item-715-health-check-templates).

This resource is FHIR Questionnaire representation of the templates above.

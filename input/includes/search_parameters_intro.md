Below is an overview of the mandatory and optional search parameters and combined search parameters. FHIR search operations and the syntax used to describe the interactions is described <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/search.html">here</a>.

Any search parameter defined in FHIR may be 'allowed' by the system unless explicitly marked as "**SHALL NOT**". A few items are marked as **MAY** in this implementation guide to highlight their potential relevance.
